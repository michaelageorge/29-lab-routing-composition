### Description
* Warmup
  * Refactored a given starter code to render the ```<div>``` and the ```<span>``` using the children property. 
  * The purpose of this assignment is to use it as a warmup.

* Conditionals:
  * Create an ```If``` component that can be used as a conditional. This component should have logic to hide/show it's ```props.children```.

* Modal 
  * Create a modal that can open and close on a button click. When active, it should render it's ```prop.children```. It should draw itself with a close icon. It should be able to close.

* Cards and Decks
  * With given starter code, use the ```content.json``` file as a guide/source to create a page of cards and decks with the following baseline considerations
  * ```<Page />``` is a collection of Deck components
  * ```<Deck />``` is a collection of Card components
  * ```<Card />``` should be a representation of content record in markup  

### Tests
* Use ```npm test``` in the root directory.
